There is a module in the file ./HW-1/tree.js which contains 2 functions: tree and treeFile. The first one is for HW-1 and the second one is for HW-2.

To run the code simply use "node HW-x/main.js". For the second one you MUST specify directory and CAN specify depth.

In HW-1 the code prints JSON in the tree form and in HW-2 it prints all the directories in files in the given path in the tree form
