There is a module in the file ./HW-1/tree.js which contains 2 functions: tree and treeFile. The first one is for HW-1 and the second one is for HW-2.

To run the code for tasks 1 and 2 simply use "node HW-x/main.js". For the second one you MUST specify directory and CAN specify depth.

For task 3 you can run the server.js to set up the server on port 8080. Then, you can use bombard command as explained in the task (all -something are required, i.e. no default values). You can use any http URL
